# Building a Mobile Coffee Brand from the Ground Up

Arabica Coffee Co. needed more than just a logo—they needed a complete brand identity that could work across everything from coffee carts to corporate events. As Cape Town's premier mobile coffee bar service, their brand had to be professional enough for high-end weddings while approachable enough for weekend markets.

## The Challenge

Starting with a blank canvas, we needed to create a cohesive brand identity that would:

- Work across diverse applications: from business cards to coffee carts
- Appeal to both corporate clients and wedding planners
- Stand out at markets and festivals across the Western Cape
- Support future digital commerce expansion

## Our Approach

We developed a comprehensive brand system built from the ground up, ensuring every touchpoint reflected Arabica's commitment to quality coffee and exceptional service.

### Complete Brand Identity

**Logo & Visual System**
We created a distinctive brand mark that balances sophistication with approachability—perfect for both elegant weddings and bustling corporate functions.

**Corporate Stationery**
Professional business cards, letterheads, and marketing materials that help Arabica present confidently to corporate clients and event planners.

**Physical Brand Applications**
From coffee cart branding to staff clothing and event signage, every element reinforces the Arabica identity at every customer touchpoint.

## Digital Presence

We built their website on WordPress, creating a platform that showcases their services and makes it easy for clients to request quotes for events. The site is designed to grow with the business, with plans for an e-commerce platform launching soon to sell their specialty coffee beans and brewing equipment.

### Key Features

- Mobile coffee bar service showcase
- Event portfolio and testimonials
- Easy quote request system
- Future-ready e-commerce foundation

## Results

Arabica now has a professional brand presence that supports their growth across the Western Cape's events industry. The cohesive identity helps them compete for premium corporate clients while maintaining strong connections with wedding planners and market organizers.

- Complete brand system ready for expansion
- Professional website supporting lead generation
- Physical branding across all customer touchpoints
- Foundation set for e-commerce growth
