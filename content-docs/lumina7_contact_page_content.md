Key principle: **Offer multiple contact methods** (calendar booking, WhatsApp, email, phone) so prospects choose their preference.

---

## HERO SECTION

### Hero Headline
**"Let's Talk"**

**Why this works:**
- Short, clear, conversational
- Lowercase "talk" = approachable
- One word is memorable
- Immediately signals purpose

**Why NOT:** 
- ❌ "Contact Us" (generic)
- ❌ "Get In Touch" (corporate)
- ❌ "Schedule Your Discovery Call" (too specific)

### Hero Subtext
**"We'd love to learn more about you and what we can design and build together."**

**Why this works:**
- "We'd love to" = warm, personal
- "Learn more about you" = partnership focus
- "Design and build together" = collaboration language
- Sets expectations for positive interaction
- Shows interest in their success

### Hero Visual
- Professional office or workspace image
- Consider: Team on a call, collaborative workspace, or outdoor setting
- Size: 800x800px (square) or responsive
- Alt text: "Lumina7 office in Cape Town"
- Purpose: Humanize the team, show welcoming environment

---

## CONTACT OPTIONS SECTION

### Section Title
**"Multiple ways to reach us"**

**Or could be:**
- "How to get started"
- "Let's connect"
- "Find the best way to reach us"

### Contact Method 1: Discovery Call

**Heading:** "Book a Free Discovery Call"

**Subheading:** "Schedule a 30-minute conversation with our team"

**Description:**
"The best way to discuss your project is in a live conversation. We'll ask about your business, goals, and timeline. You'll get a better sense of how we work and whether we're the right fit. No pressure – just genuine conversation about what's possible."

**Why this works:**
- Clarifies what the call is about
- Sets expectations (30 minutes)
- Frames it as mutual evaluation
- Removes pressure
- "No pressure" directly addresses fear of sales pitch

**CTA Button:**
- Text: "Schedule a Call"
- Link: Calendly/Cal.com booking link
