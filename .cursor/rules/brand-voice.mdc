## **Voice Checklist:**

Before publishing any content, ask:
- [ ] Does this sound like a trusted business advisor?
- [ ] Is the language accessible to non-designers?
- [ ] Are we leading with business outcomes?
- [ ] Does this build trust rather than impress?
- [ ] Would an executive and procurement officer both understand this?

This voice foundation ensures all your content feels consistent and authentically reflects your "guiding light" mission while speaking directly to your target audience's business concerns.
